This will show you how to automate Veeam Agent for Windows

Hello Git world,

I have decided to present you a way to automate your Veeam install.
In line 12 of this code I placed a ** field.
I used my OneDrive and shared the download file.
You can make the link a downloadable link by removing everything after the ? and adding download=1.
Feel free to add your concerns.
